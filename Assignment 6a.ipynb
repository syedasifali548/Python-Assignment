    "Qno 1 Define object oriented programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the object-oriented model. To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming language.  Many modern programming languages are object-oriented, however some older programming languages, such as Pascal, do offer object-oriented versions. Examples of object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++\n",

    "Qno 2 List down the benefits of OOP?\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "Re-usability. It means reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. ...\n",
    "Data Redundancy\n",
    "Code Maintenance.\n",
    "Security.\n",
    "Design Benefits.\n",
    "Better productivity.\n",
    "Easy troubleshooting.\n",

    "Qno 3 Difference between function and method?\n",
    "Ans Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent).\n",
    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it is invoked.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",
    "A method can operate on the data (instance variables) that is contained by the corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Function is block of code that is also called by its name. (independent)\n",
    "The function can have different parameters or may not have any at all. If any data (parameters) are passed, they are passed explicitly.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",
    "Function does not deal with Class and its instance concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qno 4 Define the following terms:\n",
    "Class\n",
    "Object\n",
    "Attribute\n",
    "Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "A class is used in object-oriented programming to describe one or more objects. It serves as a template for creating, or instantiating, specific objects within a program. While each object is created from a single class, one class can be used to instantiate multiple objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object:\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. ... Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute:\n",
    " an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata. An attribute is frequently and generally a property of a property. However, in actual usage, the term attribute can and is often treated as equivalent to a property depending on the technology being discussed. An attribute of an object usually consists of a name and a value; of an element, a type or class name; of a file, a name and extension.\n",
